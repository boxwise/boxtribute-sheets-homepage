Import structured data from Google Sheets™ directly into Boxtribute.

Boxtribute Sheets helps humanitarian organizations save time and reduce manual data entry by seamlessly importing structured data from Google Sheets™ into the Boxtribute platform.

Designed for registered Boxtribute users, the add-on allows you to map spreadsheet columns to Boxtribute fields and push clean, validated data directly into your instance — all within seconds. Whether you’re importing beneficiary records, stock data, the importer ensures accuracy and consistency without complex file uploads.

The add-on follows Boxtribute’s nonprofit mission to empower local organizations through simple, secure technology. It uses only the permissions necessary to read the selected spreadsheet and transfer data to your Boxtribute account; no data is stored or shared outside your environment.

To use this add-on, you must have an active Boxtribute account.
