# Terms of Service – Boxtribute Sheets

**Effective Date**: 1st of August 2025

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the _Boxtribute Sheets_ (the “Add-on”). By installing or using the Add-on, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Add-on.

## 1. About the Add-on

The Add-on is published by **Stichting Boxwise** (“Boxtribute,” “we,” “us”), a nonprofit foundation registered in the Netherlands (ANBI status). It enables Boxtribute users to import data from Google Sheets™ into their Boxtribute account.

The Add-on is only available to organisations and users who have an active Boxtribute service agreement or other binding arrangement with us. These Terms complement, but do not replace, your service agreement.

## 2. Eligibility

You may use the Add-on only if you:

- are an authorised user of a Boxtribute organisation account;
- comply with your organisation’s data protection obligations; and
- accept these Terms.

## 3. Use of the Add-on

- You remain responsible for the accuracy and legality of the data you import.
- You must not use the Add-on for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes.
- Access may be revoked if you breach these Terms or your Boxtribute service agreement.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

The Add-on transfers data you select from Google Sheets™ into your Boxtribute account. Boxtribute does not use this data for any other purpose. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) for details.

## 5. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in the Add-on remain with Boxtribute. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable right to use the Add-on solely in connection with your Boxtribute account.

## 6. Availability & Support

We will use reasonable efforts to maintain the Add-on but make no guarantees of uninterrupted availability. Support is provided via your existing Boxtribute support channels.

## 7. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

The Add-on is provided “as is.” To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- Boxtribute disclaims all warranties, express or implied.
- Boxtribute shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data loss or service interruption.

## 8. Termination

You may stop using the Add-on at any time by uninstalling it. We may suspend or terminate access if necessary for security, misuse, or discontinuation of service.

## 9. Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted publicly, and continued use of the Add-on constitutes acceptance of changes.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by Dutch law. Any disputes shall be submitted to the competent courts of Rotterdam, Netherlands.
