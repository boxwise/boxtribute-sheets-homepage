# Privacy Policy – Boxtribute Sheets

**Effective Date**: 1st of August 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the _Boxtribute Sheets_ (the “Add-on”) processes user data.

## 1. Who We Are

The Add-on is operated by **Stichting Boxwise** (“Boxtribute,” “we,” “us”), a nonprofit foundation based in the Netherlands with ANBI status.

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies only to the Add-on. It complements Boxtribute’s service agreements and Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with partner organisations.

## 3. Data Processed by the Add-on

- The Add-on accesses only the Google Sheets you explicitly select.
- The Add-on transfers only selected data to your Boxtribute account.
- The Add-on does **not** access Gmail, Drive, or other Google data.

## 4. Purpose of Processing

The sole purpose of the Add-on is to allow you to import structured data into your Boxtribute account. The data is not used for analytics, marketing, or shared with third parties.

## 5. Data Storage

- The Add-on does not permanently store data outside Boxtribute systems.
- Data may be temporarily processed in memory during transfer but is deleted immediately after.
- All persistent storage occurs within your Boxtribute environment, subject to your existing service agreement and associated Data Processing Agreements.

## 6. Usage Logging

For service monitoring, Boxtribute may log metadata such as:

- organisation ID and user ID;
- timestamp of import;
- number of rows processed;
- success/failure status.

These logs are used only to maintain and improve the service.

## 7. Security

We use secure APIs and encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Boxtribute operates under GDPR and applies appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect data.

## 8. User Control

- You can uninstall the Add-on at any time, which stops all data access.
- You can also revoke the Add-on’s permissions in your Google Account settings.

## 9. Legal Basis (GDPR)

Boxtribute acts as a data processor under your organisation’s Data Processing Agreements. The legal basis for processing is the performance of the service agreement with your organisation.

## 10. Data Sharing

No data from the Add-on is shared with third parties, except as required by law.

## 11. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted publicly.
